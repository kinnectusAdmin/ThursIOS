Welcome to Thurst, operated by Thurst, Inc. (âusâ, âweâ, âCompanyâ, or âThurstâ). Weâre so excited that
youâre here! We want to make sure that you are aware of our legal obligations to you and your legal
obligations as a user on Thurst, so please be sure to read the following Terms of Use carefully.

By accessing the Thurst.com website (the âWebsiteâ) and/or mobile application (the âAppâ), and/or

terms of this Agreement, please do not continue to access the Website or the App, and please do not use
the Service.

II. CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT
Thurst is a work-in- progress, and that means that things might change as we continue to improve our
Service. We may revise this Agreement and/or our Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect
requirements of the law, new features, or changes in our business practices. All changes are effective
immediately upon posting on the Website and the App. If you continue to use the Service following the
posting of any revised Agreement, it means that you accept and agree to the changes, so please be sure to
check this Agreement regularly so you are aware of any changes we have made, as these changes are
binding.

III. ELIGIBILITY
Thurst is only open to people age 18 and up. By creating an account and using the Service, you represent
and warrant that:
- you are at least 18 years of age and have the right, authority, and capability to form a
binding contract with Thurst;
- you will comply with this Agreement and all applicable local, state, national, and
international laws, rules, and regulations.
While use of our Service is not limited to users in the United States, we make no claims that the Service

our Service may not be legal in certain countries, if you access or use the Service from outside the United
States, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with local laws.

IV. ACCOUNT SECURITY AND TERMINATION
You are solely responsible for all activities on your account. Because of that, it is very important that you
keep your account and password secure at all times. Please do not share your password and/or account
with anyone. You must notify us immediately of any unauthorized use of your credentials, unauthorized
access to your account, or any other breach of security so that we may take appropriate action.

We reserve the right, but have no obligation, to monitor content you submit to the Service and/or make
available on the Website or the App. We also reserve the right to remove any information or material,
including material that violates any applicable law or this Agreement.

provision of this Agreement, misused the Service, or behaved in a way that Thurst regards as

Upon termination of your account, this Agreement between you and Thurst will terminate, except for the
following provisions: Section V, Section VI, and Sections XI through XV.

Service and/or outside the Service. Please exercise caution in all interactions with other Service users,
particularly if you decide to communicate or meet outside the Service.

While users can opt to send in their government identification for identity verification, we do not
guarantee the truthfulness or accuracy of any content posted by any user through the Service, regardless
of whether they have been marked as identity-verified through the Service. Identity verification means
only that the name on the userâs profile matches the name on the government identification submitted by
the user.

criminal background checks on its users or otherwise inquire into the background of its users.
Thurst makes no representations or warranties as to the conduct of its users.

To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, in no event will Thurst, its affiliates or their

any kind, whether direct, indirect, special, incidental, consequential, or punitive damages,
including, but not limited to:
*   personal injury,

(ii) the conduct or content of other users or third parties on, through, or following

otherwise subject to indemnification by you, in which event you will fully cooperate with Thurst in
asserting any available defenses.

XIII. ARBITRATION, GOVERNING LAW, AND VENUE

We understand that arbitration clauses may sound intimidating. We decided to enforce this clause because
arbitration proceedings are usually simpler, cheaper, and more efficient than going to trial or engaging in
any other judicial proceedings â for you and for us.

a. The exclusive means of resolving any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to this
Agreement (including any alleged breach thereof), the Service, the Website, or the App
shall be BINDING ARBITRATION administered by the American Arbitration
Association under the Consumer Arbitration Rules, and enforced by any court having
jurisdiction thereof.
The one exception to the exclusivity of arbitration is that you have the right to bring an
individual claim against the Company in a small-claims court of competent jurisdiction.
But whether you choose arbitration or small-claims court, you may not under any
circumstances commence or maintain against the Company any class action, class
arbitration, or other representative action or proceeding.
b. By using the Website, the App, or the Service in any manner, you agree to the above
arbitration clause. In doing so, YOU GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO GO TO COURT to
assert or defend any claims between you and the Company (except for matters that may
be taken to small-claims court). YOU ALSO GIVE UP YOUR RIGHT TO
PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR OTHER CLASS PROCEEDING. Your
rights will be determined by a NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR, NOT A JUDGE OR JURY,
and the arbitrator shall determine all issues related to the dispute. You are entitled to a
fair hearing before the arbitrator. Decisions by the arbitrator are enforceable in court and
may be overturned by a court only for very limited reasons.
c. Any proceeding to enforce this arbitration agreement, including any proceeding to
confirm, modify, or vacate an arbitration award, may be commenced in any court of
competent jurisdiction. In the event that this arbitration agreement is for any reason held
to be unenforceable, any litigation against the Company (except for small-claims court
actions) may be commenced only in the federal or state courts located in California. You
hereby irrevocably consent to the jurisdiction of those courts for such purposes.
d. This Agreement, and any dispute between you and the Company, shall be governed by
the laws of the state of California without regard to principles of conflicts of law,
provided that this arbitration agreement shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act. For users residing outside the United States where our arbitration agreement may be
prohibited by law, the laws of California, U.S.A. will apply to any disputes arising out of
or relating to this Agreement.
e. All claims arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Service, the Website, or the
App and not covered by the arbitration provision will be litigated exclusively in the
federal or state courts of California, and you consent to personal jurisdiction in those
courts.

XIV. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
This Agreement constitutes the sole and entire agreement between you and Thurst with respect to use of
the Service, the Website, and the App. If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the remainder of
this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

The failure of Thurst to exercise or enforce any right or provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a
waiver of such right or provision. You agree that your account is non-transferable and all of your rights to
your profile or contents within your account terminate upon your death. No agency, partnership, joint
venture or employment is created as a result of this Agreement and you may not make any representations
or bind Thurst in any manner.
